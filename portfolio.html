    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a final year computer science student with a passion for technology and software development. Currently, I am focused on learning Android development, alongside my proficiency in Python-based web development using Flask. While I am not yet experienced with Django or React, I am actively learning and eager to expand my skillset.</p>
    <p>My journey in programming started with Java, and I have since explored various areas including web development, machine learning, and cybersecurity. Through projects and internships, I have gained practical experience and honed my problem-solving skills.</p>
    <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy staying updated with the latest trends in technology, participating in hackathons, and contributing to open-source projects. I am driven by a desire to continuously learn and grow, and I am currently seeking internship opportunities to further develop my skills and contribute to real-world projects.</p>
